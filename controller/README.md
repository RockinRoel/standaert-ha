# Standaert Home Automation Controller

![A picture of the PCB](picture.jpg)

This repository contains the C++ code used on the Arduino Nano
that controls the home automation system at my parents' house.

The controller is placed on a board with 32 inputs and 32
outputs. It uses IÂ²C communication with 4 MCP23017 IO expanders,
and can communicate with another system, like a Raspberry Pi,
over a serial connection. See the
[PCB repository](https://gitlab.com/RockinRoel/standaert-ha-pcb)
for more information on the board and its specifications.

This code uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) and
the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) framework.
